Hi {{ business_name }},

I’d like to share Appleseed — a lead generation and outreach automation tool.

Appleseed found your business and wrote you this email.

And it’s open source.

### You can use it for free:

1. Clone the code: https://github.com/your-repo/leadgen-mailer
2. Open the folder in **Windows PowerShell**
3. Run:
    ~ python -m venv venv
    ~ .\venv\Scripts\Activate
    ~ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ~ python main.py

4. When prompted, enter your **email address**  
If you're using Gmail or Google Workspace:
- Enable **2-Step Verification**
- Visit [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
- Generate a 16-character password and paste it into `main.py` under `SMTP_CONFIG`

Once set up, Appleseed will send your custom outreach emails on your behalf.

If you’d like help installing or customizing it, drop me a line.
